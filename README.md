# Idle-game

A simple proof of concept of an idle-game in react.

## Game Basics

Basic unit is a `tick`.

Players starts with a budget of 5 `ticks`, enough to buy the first generator.

Each generator will have a production rate of `ticks` which can be improved by upgrading the generator using ... `ticks`.

Upgrades get more expensive overtime and players will have to find a strategy to get most out of their 5 generators to reach the largest amount of money in less time possible.
